We draw on existing insights regarding the Darwinian, Communitarian, and Missionary orientation of entrepreneurs and on interviews with 29 founders to develop our hypotheses, which we then test in a sample of 58 academic and 113 non-academic founders that participated in a venture competition. We argue that, compared to non-academic institutional logics, academic logics are tied to a stronger Communitarian and Missionary orientation and a weaker Darwinian orientation in founders. A stronger Darwinian orientation values venture growth, whereas a stronger Communitarian orientation appraises the benefit of the technology for a restricted set of people at the expense of such growth ambitions. A stronger Missionary orientation values welfare maximization for society which may to some degree entail higher growth aspirations. We argue and empirically confirm that these identity orientations explain why academic founders hold lower growth aspirations for their start-up than non-academic founders. Our findings can at least partially clarify why academic start-ups do not grow according to expectancies. They theoretically advance our insights in academic entrepreneurship and founders' growth aspirations while also extending the literature on founders' identity orientation. © 2022",Economic and social effects; Academic entrepreneurship; Commercialisation; Economic development; Economic growths; Emotion; Identity orientation; Institutional logic; Intention; Social groups; Welfare maximizations; Technology transfer,Academic entrepreneurship; Commercialization; Economic development and growth; Emotion; Intention; Motivation; Technology transfer,,,"ICM-FWO; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, FWO",We sincerely thank the contest organizers for their support during the data collection of this study.

Increasingly, algorithms can provide similar assistance. When algorithms assist or augment producers, does this change individuals’ willingness to assign credit to those producers? Across four studies spanning several domains (e.g., painting, construction, sports analytics, and entrepreneurship), we find evidence that producers receive more credit for work when they are assisted by algorithms, compared with humans. We also find that individuals assume algorithmic assistance requires more producer oversight than human assistance does, a mechanism that explains these higher attributions of credit (Studies 1–3). The greater credit individuals assign to producers assisted by algorithms (vs. other people) also manifests itself in increased support for those producers’ entrepreneurial endeavors (Study 4). As algorithms proliferate, norms of credit and authorship are likely changing, precipitating a variety of economic and social consequences. © 2023 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.",adult;

One existing problem with the current literature is that it is not fully clear under what conditions social entrepreneurship can promote sustainable economic, social, and environmental developments. The research evidence is even less in developing and emerging economies like China. Once an impoverished area, Yiwu has gone through a unique evolution path and developed into one of China’s top 10 wealthiest counties and a model city for sustainable development. In this study, based on a multilevel perspective and through analyzing objective statistical records and public archive data in Yiwu, we trace social entrepreneurship and sustainable development in Yiwu in recent decades. We make numerous theoretical contributions to social entrepreneurship and sustainable development literature. We identify the key factors and explore the roles of social entrepreneurship in promoting sustainable development in Yiwu. We discuss theoretical implications for social entrepreneurship specifically and entrepreneurship in general and make future research recommendations for our framework. Overall, we broaden and deepen the research on social entrepreneurship and sustainable development in an emerging economy.
