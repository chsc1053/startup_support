Deployment of charging infrastructure is needed to accelerate technology adoption; however, managers and policymakers have had limited evidence on the use of public charging stations due to poor data sharing and decentralized ownership across regions. In this article, we use machine learning based classifiers to reveal insights about consumer charging behavior in 72 detected languages including Chinese. We investigate 10 years of consumer reviews in East and Southeast Asia from 2011 to 2021 to enable infrastructure evaluation at a larger geographic scale than previously available. We find evidence that charging stations at government locations result in higher failure rates with consumers compared to charging stations at private points of interest. This evidence contrasts with predictions in the U.S. and European markets, where the performance is closer to parity. We also find that networked stations with communication protocols provide a relatively higher quality of charging services, which favors policy support for connectivity, particularly for underserved or remote areas. © 2023 The Authors",,Charging infrastructure; Consumer behavior; Electric vehicles; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Public policy; Transformer algorithms

However, currently accepted views on these subjects have, to date, been put forth without any basis on a true physical theory of how the brain communicates internally via its electrical signals. This lack of a solid theoretical framework has implications not only for our understanding of how the brain works, but also for wide range of computational models developed from the standard orthodox view of brain neuronal organization and brain network derived functioning based on the Hodgkin–Huxley ad-hoc circuit analogies that have produced a multitude of Artificial, Recurrent, Convolution, Spiking, etc., Neural Networks (ARCSe NNs) that have in turn led to the standard algorithms that form the basis of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods. Our hypothesis, based upon our recently developed physical model of weakly evanescent brain wave propagation (WETCOW) is that, contrary to the current orthodox model that brain neurons just integrate and fire under accompaniment of slow leaking, they can instead perform much more sophisticated tasks of efficient coherent synchronization/desynchronization guided by the collective influence of propagating nonlinear near critical brain waves, the waves that currently assumed to be nothing but inconsequential subthreshold noise. In this paper we highlight the learning and memory capabilities of our WETCOW framework and then apply it to the specific application of AI/ML and Neural Networks. We demonstrate that the learning inspired by these critically synchronized brain waves is shallow, yet its timing and accuracy outperforms deep ARCSe counterparts on standard test datasets. These results have implications for both our understanding of brain function and for the wide range of AI/ML applications. © 2023, The Author(s).","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Brain Waves; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; brain function; brain nerve cell; electroencephalogram; human; human cell; human experiment; learning; machine learning; memory; noise; physical model; algorithm; artificial intelligence; brain; physiology",

Methods: In this retrospective study, four frequently used machine learning models, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), deep neural network (DNN), and XGBoost (XGB), were compared to identify significant clinical features from 24 input features associated with the TBI risk in children under age two under the permutation feature importance test (PermFIT) framework by using the publicly available data set from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) study. The prediction accuracy was determined by comparing the predicted TBI status with the computed tomography (CT) scan results since CT scan is the gold standard for diagnosing TBI. Results: At a significance level of p= 0.05 , DNN, RF, XGB, and SVM identified 9, 1, 2, and 4 significant features, respectively. In a comparison of accuracy (Accuracy), the area under the curve (AUC), and the precision-recall area under the curve (PR-AUC), the permutation feature importance test for DNN model was the most powerful framework for identifying significant features and outperformed other methods, i.e., RF, XGB, and SVM, with Accuracy, AUC, and PR-AUC as 0.915, 0.794, and 0.974, respectively. Conclusion: These results indicate that the PermFIT-DNN framework robustly identifies significant clinical features associated with TBI status and improves prediction performance. The findings could be used to inform the development of clinical decision tools designed to inform triage decisions. © 2023, The Author(s).","Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Child; Clinical Decision Rules; Emergency Medical Services; Humans; Infant; Neural Networks, Computer; Retrospective Studies; child; diagnostic imaging; emergency health service; human; infant; retrospective study; traumatic brain injury",Deep neural network; Diagnosis test; Feature importance; Head trauma; Permutation; Testable machine learning
