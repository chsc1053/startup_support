# Startup Support: Research & Data for Informed Decisions
This project assists entrepreneurs by providing access to relevant research and data, helping them make informed decisions.

The project involves several key steps:

1. Keyword-based Search: Enter relevant keywords, and the project will extract related documents from the Scopus database (Output: CSV file).
2. Key Term Identification: The project then identifies key terms from the extracted documents (Output: Keywords).
3. Clustering Key Terms: Finally, identified keywords are grouped into meaningful clusters to highlight key themes (Output: Clusters).
